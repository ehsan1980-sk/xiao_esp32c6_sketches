# Additional Libraries

The `async_web_led` sketch is dependent on two libraries

  1. [AsyncTCP](https://github.com/me-no-dev/AsyncTCP)
  2. [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer)

Minimalist copies of the libraries are included in the [../../libraries](../../libraries/README.md) directory. **Please do not redistribute these files and always return to the original source when using the libraries in other projects.**

Each of the libraries is released under the LGPL-3.0 licence. Its terms can be found in `libraries/AsyncTCP/LICENSE`.
